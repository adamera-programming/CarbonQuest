# CarbonQuest
CarbonQuest is a mobile app focused on reducing climate change. It helps users to track their pollution and gives them goals to reduce their carbon footprint.

Motivation:
Climate change education tools often fail to provide personalized, actionable feedback. CarbonQuest addresses that issue by offering user specific impact and offering targeted suggestions.

Features:
- Carbon footpring estimation based on daily activites
- Interactive chatbot providing personalized feedback
- Educational insights on emissions and sustainability

What I Learned:
- Building a mobile app
- Translating real world problems into software
- Designing user-focused interfaces
